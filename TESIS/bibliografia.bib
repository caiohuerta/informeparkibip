abstract = {Biofeedback is a mind-body technique in which individuals learn how to modify their physiology for the purpose of improving physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. Much like physical therapy, biofeedback training requires active participation on the part of patients and often regular practice between training sessions. Clinical biofeedback may be used to manage disease symptoms as well as to improve overall health and wellness through stress management training. Research has shown that biofeedback interventions are efficacious in treating a variety of medical conditions, and many Americans are turning to biofeedback and other less traditional therapies for their routine healthcare. Clinical biofeedback training is growing increasingly popular in the USA, as many people are seeking out relatively new approaches to healthcare. This article provides an overview of clinical biofeedback training, outlines two models of training, details research which has established how effective biofeedback is in patients with a given disease, and describes who should be referred for biofeedback training. {\textcopyright} 2010 Radcliffe Publishing.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the possibility of using uni-axial gyroscopes to develop a simple portable gait analysis system. Gyroscopes were attached on the skin surface of the shank and thigh segments and the angular velocity for each segment was recorded in each segment. Segment inclinations and knee angle were derived from segment angular velocities. The angular signals from a motion analysis system were used to evaluate the angular velocities and the derived signals from the gyroscopes. There was a good correlation between these signals. When performing a turn the signals of segment inclination and knee angle drifted. Two methods were used to solve this: automatically resetting the system to re-initialise the angle in each gait cycle, and high-pass filtering. They both successfully corrected this drift. A single gyroscope on the shank segment could provide information on segment inclination range, cadence, number of steps, and an estimation of stride length and walking speed.},

abstract = "In this study we describe an ambulatory system for estimation of spatio-temporal parameters during long periods of walking. This original method based on wavelet analysis is proposed to compute the values of temporal gait parameters from the angular velocity of lower limbs. Based on a mechanical model, the medio-lateral rotation of the lower limbs during stance and swing, the stride length and velocity are estimated by integration of the angular velocity. Measurement's accuracy was assessed using as a criterion standard the information provided by foot pressure sensors. To assess the accuracy of the method on a broad range of performance for each gait parameter, we gathered data from young and elderly subjects. No significant error was observed for toe-off detection, while a slight systematic delay (10ms on average) existed between heelstrike obtained from gyroscopes and footswitch. There was no significant difference between actual spatial parameters (stride length and velocity) and their estimated values. Errors for velocity and stride length estimations were 0.06m/s and 0.07m, respectively. This system is light, portable, inexpensive and does not provoke any discomfort to subjects. It can be carried for long periods of time, thus providing new longitudinal information such as stride-to-stride variability of gait. Several clinical applications can be proposed such as outcome evaluation after total knee or hip replacement, external prosthesis adjustment for amputees, monitoring of rehabilitation progress, gait analysis in neurological diseases, and fall risk estimation in elderly."

abstract = "We investigated whether a wearable system based on a commercial Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) can reliably provide the main spatiotemporal gait parameters in subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD), compared to a gold-standard optoelectronic motion capture system. The gait of 22 subjects with PD (Age: 69.4 (6.1) years; UPDRS-III: 28.0 (9.2)) was recorded simultaneously with an optoelectronic system and a commercial IMU-based wearable system. Eight spatiotemporal parameters describing the step cycle (cadence, velocity, stride length, stride duration, step length, stance, swing and double support duration) were compared between the two systems. The IMU and the optical system reported comparable gait parameters, with the exception of walking velocity (optical system, 0.72 (0.27) m∙s−1 vs. IMU: 0.86 (0.26) m∙s−1, p < 0.05). Although most parameters detected by the two systems were not statistically different, some of them like stride length, double support and step duration showed notable root mean square and mean absolute errors. In conclusion, the algorithm embedded in the current release of the commercial IMU requires further improvements to be properly used with subjects with PD. Overall, the IMU system was sufficiently accurate in the assessment of fundamental gait spatiotemporal parameters. The fast and simplified data recording process allowed by wearables makes this technology appealing and represents a possible solution for the quantification of gait in the clinical context, especially when using a traditional 3D optoelectronic gait analysis is not possible, and when subjects are not fully cooperative."

Abstract = {The article presents a research on Version Control with source code management system for software development Git and repository hosting service GitHub. Topics discussed include development of version control system by software engineers to track iterative changes made in code, use of graphical user interfaces for running Git and requirement of computational biological applications on management of data files by alignments of short reads from a ChIP-sequence experiment to the human genome.},

abstract="This chapter introduces you to using Git. Git is the most amazing source control versioning system (a source control system allows you to track the various versions and edits of all your code files) for files that I've ever used, and it's the source control system the Drupal community has favored for a number of years. (drupal.org previously used svn and prior to that cvs.) In this chapter you're also going to be looking at using github.com. Github is a vendor that hosts Git repositories. It is free for shared code (code that is made public to the world), but Git charges a fee for private repositories. As you probably know by now, the code for this book is kept at Github: https://github.com/barnettech/drupal8{\_}web{\_}programming{\_}essentials. You'll practice managing your files using Github, and you'll also learn several useful Git commands for working with your files.",
